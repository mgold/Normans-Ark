Norman's Ark============Max Goldstein, Kelly Moran, Jason JacobFinal Project for [COMP 150VIZ](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150VIZ/) at Tufts UniversityA visualization of test results for programming assignments, implemented inProvessing and available [online](http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~mgolds07/nark/).Run It Locally--------------The main file is `main.pde`. Processing requires that all `.pde` files beenclosed in a directory called `main`.Run It Online-------------A sample `index.html` and `style.css` are provided. The code itself is poweredby [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/download/). The layout requires[Twitter Bootstap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), which is probablyoverkill for this project but oh well. You will need local copies of bothscripts and to change `index.html` to point to them. You can modify the buttonsat the top to create a website of different test suite results.We reccomend users who have access to the non-anonymized data set up passwordsfor their website at the apache level.
